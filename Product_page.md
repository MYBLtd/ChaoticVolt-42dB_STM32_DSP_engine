Every speaker in the ChaoticVolt 42decibels family is built around one idea: premium sound should feel effortless - stable, consistent, and refined - without needing constant tweaking.

Our wireless audio chain is engineered end-to-end:

- A high-quality Bluetooth audio module for reliable A2DP music streaming, and
- A real-time 32-bit DSP microcontroller that shapes the sound with precision before it reaches the power stage.

## Wireless That Stays Premium, Even Outside the Lab

Bluetooth audio is a real-world radio link. Distance, walls, and crowded 2.4 GHz airspace can affect stability and clarity.

That's why we focus on what matters in everyday listening:

- Consistent performance and clean transients
- Stable stereo imaging
- Graceful behavior under challenging RF conditions

### What to Realistically Expect from Bluetooth Streaming

- Stereo, 44.1 kHz / 48 kHz
- Modern lossy codecs (AAC/SBC) chosen automatically by your device for compatibility and stability
- The speaker is designed to make this sound premium - but Bluetooth itself remains the limiting link

## DSP Voicing: Bigger, Clearer, More Controlled

Our DSP isn't a "sound effect." It's a carefully tuned processing chain that makes the speaker feel more confident and more expensive in real rooms:

- **Curated voicing presets** for different scenarios
- **Loudness shaping** to keep weight and body at lower volumes
- **Optional bass enhancement** when you want extra impact
- **Dynamic control + limiting** for clean peaks and stable loudness
- **Headroom management** to prevent clipping and avoid surprising level jumps when switching modes
- **Reference mode:** DSP bypass for direct, unprocessed playback and quick A/B checks

---

## Control from iPhone - And Right from Your Wrist

Tune the sound the way you like it:

- Switch presets
- Enable/disable bass enhancement
- Toggle bypass
- Adjust key listening modes

...directly from your iPhone, and also from an Apple Watch for fast, effortless control while you're moving around the room.

## Honest Expectations (The Premium Way)

- **Connection quality matters:** the best sound happens when your phone is close and the RF path is clear.
- **Source quality matters:** highly compressed streams can't become lossless - but the DSP can make them smoother, cleaner, and more enjoyable.
- **Simple troubleshooting:** if sound quality drops, move closer first - then restart playback or re-pair.

## Quick Tips for Maximum Sound

- Keep your device within 1–3 meters for the most stable RF conditions.
- Use the highest streaming quality (or lossless where available).
- If sound quality drops: move closer → restart playback → toggle Bluetooth → re-pair.
